          <p>Senior Software Engineering Project is a year long course in which students work in teams on a real-life project from industry, University affiliate, or non-profit organization. Rather than participate as a team member, students with significant full-time work experience as a software developer take the fall portion of the course working as mentors for teams. Students working on interdisciplinary projects in other departments take the fall portion of the course with their project component satisfied in another department.</p>
