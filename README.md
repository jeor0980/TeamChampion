# Team Champion

University of Colorado Senior Capstone Project  
Spring 2017

## Description
Team Champion's Sorting Hat is a web-based application sponsored by the University of Colorado senior capstone instructors. Sorting Hat provides a streamlined approach to creating groups for the yearlong capstone project based upon group specification and various user data. It utilizes an algorithm based upon the Gale-Shapley stable marriage solution and displays the compiled groups in a simple to use web interface.

## To Run
Clone the repository and open a command terminal. Ensure an instance of MongoDB is running on your machine. From the Team Champion root directory, run the command    
```bash
$ python runserver.py
```    
Then, open the address http://localhost:5000/ from your favorite web browser!
